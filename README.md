# Heart Disease Risk Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes heart disease risk factors using a dataset containing various health indicators. The goal is to identify key contributors to heart disease and provide data-driven insights for prevention and early detection.

## Dataset Overview

- The dataset consists of multiple health-related attributes, including **age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, BMI, and blood sugar levels**.
- Data preprocessing included handling missing values, outlier detection, and standardization.
- The dataset was analyzed to explore trends and correlations between health indicators and heart disease prevalence.

## Key Insights

- Individuals diagnosed with **heart disease** generally exhibited:
  - **Higher triglyceride levels**
  - **Elevated BMI (Body Mass Index)**
  - **Slightly increased blood sugar levels**
- Cholesterol and blood pressure levels did not show a strong correlation with heart disease in this dataset.
- Age distribution suggests that heart disease risk **increases significantly after 45 years**.

## Findings

- **Triglycerides and BMI** are strong **indicators** of heart disease risk.
- **Blood sugar levels** may also contribute to the likelihood of developing heart disease.
- **Gender-based differences** indicate men may be at higher risk compared to women.
- The analysis is **descriptive**, meaning further statistical testing (e.g., regression modeling) is needed for stronger causal conclusions.

## Recommendations

ðŸ“Œ **Healthcare Practitioners:**

- Encourage routine **BMI & triglyceride monitoring** for early detection.
- Advise lifestyle changes targeting **weight management and dietary improvements**.

ðŸ“Œ **Patients:**

- Maintain a **healthy weight** to reduce heart disease risk.
- Monitor **blood sugar and triglyceride levels**, particularly for individuals over 45.

ðŸ“Œ **Future Research:**

- Conduct **predictive modeling** to refine risk assessment.
- Include additional lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, diet, exercise) for deeper insights.

## Conclusion

- **Heart disease risk factors include BMI, triglycerides, and blood sugar levels.**
- Data suggests **preventive measures** should focus on **weight management and triglyceride control**.
- Further **multivariate analysis** is required to determine stronger causality.

## Next Steps

- Apply **machine learning models** (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) for risk prediction.
- Validate findings with **larger datasets** to improve generalizability.
