# Heart Disease Risk Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes heart disease risk factors using a dataset containing various health indicators. The analysis includes data exploration, statistical correlation, and visualization of key variables to identify trends associated with heart disease.

## Dataset Overview

- The dataset consists of multiple health-related attributes, including **age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, BMI, blood sugar levels, smoking habits, and physical activity**.
- Data preprocessing included handling missing values and standardization.
- The analysis focused on identifying key contributors to heart disease.

## Key Insights

- **Age Distribution:** The risk of heart disease increases significantly after **age 45**.
- **Triglycerides and BMI:** Individuals diagnosed with heart disease tend to have **higher triglyceride levels and BMI**.
- **Blood Sugar:** Slightly elevated blood sugar levels were observed in individuals with heart disease.
- **Gender Differences:** Males exhibited a **higher prevalence** of heart disease compared to females.
- **Smoking and Lifestyle Factors:** 
  - Smoking was more common in individuals with heart disease.
  - Regular physical activity appeared to be associated with a **lower risk** of heart disease.
  - Alcohol consumption data showed no significant pattern in relation to heart disease.
- **Cholesterol & Blood Pressure:** These factors did not show a strong correlation with heart disease in this dataset.

## Findings

- **Triglycerides and BMI are strong indicators of heart disease risk.**
- **Blood sugar levels may also contribute** to the likelihood of developing heart disease.
- **Smoking was linked to a higher prevalence of heart disease**, while regular exercise appeared to be a protective factor.
- **Gender differences suggest men may be at higher risk** than women.
- **The correlation heatmap confirmed that triglycerides and BMI have the strongest relationship with heart disease.**
- The analysis is **descriptive**, and further statistical testing (e.g., regression modeling) is needed to establish stronger causal relationships.

## Recommendations

ðŸ“Œ **Healthcare Practitioners:**

- Encourage **BMI and triglyceride monitoring** for early detection of heart disease.
- Promote **smoking cessation programs and increased physical activity**.
- Educate patients on the **importance of maintaining healthy blood sugar levels**.
- Consider targeted interventions for individuals **above 45 years of age**.

ðŸ“Œ **Patients:**

- Maintain a **healthy weight** to reduce heart disease risk.
- Monitor **blood sugar and triglyceride levels**, particularly for individuals over 45.
- Engage in **regular physical activity** to lower heart disease risk.
- Avoid **smoking and adopt healthier lifestyle habits**.

ðŸ“Œ **Future Research:**

- Conduct **predictive modeling** to refine risk assessment.
- Further analyze **the combined impact of multiple lifestyle factors on heart disease progression**.
- Investigate **causal relationships** using advanced statistical techniques.

## Conclusion

- **Heart disease risk factors include BMI, triglycerides, blood sugar levels, and smoking habits.**
- Data suggests **preventive measures** should focus on **weight management, triglyceride control, and smoking cessation**.
- Further **multivariate analysis** is required to determine stronger causality.

## Next Steps

- Apply **machine learning models** (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) for risk prediction.
- Validate findings with **larger datasets** to improve generalizability.
- Conduct **longitudinal studies** to better understand lifestyle impacts on heart disease.
