# Heart Disease Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes heart disease risk factors among **individuals aged 30 and below** using a dataset containing various health indicators. The analysis explores statistical correlations and visualizations to identify trends associated with heart disease in younger individuals.

## Dataset Overview

- The dataset includes multiple health-related attributes, such as **age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, BMI, blood sugar levels, smoking habits, and physical activity**.
- Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values and standardization.
- The focus of the analysis was to determine key contributors to heart disease in younger individuals.

## Key Insights

- **Age Group Focus:** The study exclusively examines individuals aged **30 years and below**.
- **Triglycerides and BMI:** Individuals diagnosed with heart disease tend to have **higher triglyceride levels and BMI**.
- **Blood Sugar Levels:** Slightly elevated blood sugar levels were observed in individuals with heart disease.
- **Gender Differences:** Males exhibited a **higher prevalence** of heart disease compared to females.
- **Lifestyle Factors:**
  - **Smoking:** More prevalent among individuals diagnosed with heart disease.
  - **Physical Activity:** Regular exercise was associated with a **lower risk** of heart disease.
  - **Alcohol Consumption:** No significant correlation was observed between alcohol consumption and heart disease.
- **Cholesterol & Blood Pressure:** These factors did not show a strong correlation with heart disease in this dataset.

## Findings

- **Triglycerides and BMI are strong indicators of heart disease risk.**
- **Elevated blood sugar levels may contribute** to heart disease likelihood.
- **Smoking was linked to a higher prevalence of heart disease**, while regular exercise appeared to be a protective factor.
- **Men had a higher prevalence of heart disease compared to women.**
- **The correlation heatmap confirmed that triglycerides and BMI have the strongest relationship with heart disease.**
- The analysis is **descriptive**, and further statistical testing (e.g., regression modeling) is required to establish stronger causal relationships.

## Recommendations

ðŸ“Œ **Healthcare Practitioners:**

- Encourage **BMI and triglyceride monitoring** for early detection of heart disease.
- Promote **smoking cessation programs and increased physical activity**.
- Educate patients on the **importance of maintaining healthy blood sugar levels**.
- Consider targeted interventions for **younger individuals at risk**.

ðŸ“Œ **Individuals at Risk:**

- Maintain a **healthy weight** to reduce heart disease risk.
- Regularly monitor **blood sugar and triglyceride levels** to identify early warning signs.
- Engage in **consistent physical activity** to lower heart disease risk.
- Avoid **smoking and adopt healthier lifestyle habits**.

## Conclusion

- **Heart disease risk factors among young individuals include BMI, triglycerides, blood sugar levels, and smoking habits.**
- Preventive strategies should emphasize **weight management, triglyceride control, and smoking cessation**.
- Additional **multivariate analysis** is needed to determine stronger causality and risk prediction.

### ðŸš€ This analysis provides valuable insights for heart disease prevention among young individuals. Stay healthy! ðŸ’™
